//! Orchestrator — the agent loop that coordinates LLM calls, tools,
//! safety checks, and memory.
//!
//! Module layout:
//! - [`tool_exec`] — `handle_tool_calls` and the parallel async variant.
//! - [`compaction`] — `maybe_autocompact`, `summarize_via_provider`,
//!   `build_messages` (delegates to [`crate::context::ContextEngine`]).
//! - [`run`] — the top-level `run` and `run_stream` agent loops.
//!
//! Request-shaping helpers (`build_request_messages`,
//! `truncate_tool_result`, `sanitize_for_provider`,
//! `CLEARED_TOOL_RESULT_PLACEHOLDER`) now live in
//! [`crate::context::builder`].
